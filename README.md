# DevOps 
// s h a l b - blog
- Umbrella Term
- Set of practices 
	- using different tools differently in different orgs
- Continuous Learning

- Share internal customer feedback - show them non technical release notes

### CI/CD
- cont. integration + cont. deploy 
- yaml code - github action
- automated process
- continuous deployment & cont. delivery 
 
### IaC
- aws ec2 - t2.micro / large - based on the requirement
- consistency - version control
- terraform ec2
	- ec2 instance
	- t2.micro = server size
	- use this template to multiply scalability
	- without this: how do you debug the settings done through aws options. hassle.
	- similar to version control for infrastructure
	- terraform - state_file - current state of the infrastructure - someone changed only the t2.micro settings 

### Automated testing
- pytest

### Monitoring & Logging ***
- Reliability, scalability, availability

## Conclusion
- Automation - but how much ? - reddit blog
- github actions > jenkins

----
- render | simple ci/cd pipeline
- autoscaling in ec2 instance | horizontal or vertical 
	- customer rising suddenly from 10k to 100k 
		- need server configuration

capEx - capital expendature
OpEx - operational expendature

Networking background - plus point
Devops top - automation code writing
